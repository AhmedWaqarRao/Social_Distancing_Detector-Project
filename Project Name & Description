Social Distancing DetectorSocial Distancing Detector

Used YOLO pre-trained model trained on COCO dataset. 
That pre-trained model also contains person class. 
So, we made sure that we only detect person class 
while performing Social Distancing Detector since COCO dataset is based on 80 classes.
We specified the index of Label person accordingly to our YOLO pre-trained model and its corresponding config file.
